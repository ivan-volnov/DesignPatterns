# DesignPatterns

Some code to illustrate various design patterns in C++

## Behavioral

In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that
identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these
patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication

- [Chain Of Responsibility](Behavioral/ChainOfResponsibility.cpp)
- [Command](Behavioral/Command.cpp) (Action, Transaction)
- [Interpreter](Behavioral/Interpreter.cpp)
- [Iterator](Behavioral/Iterator.cpp) (Cursor)
- [Mediator](Behavioral/Mediator.cpp)
- [Memento](Behavioral/Memento.cpp) (Token)
- [Observer](Behavioral/Observer.cpp) (Dependends, Publish-Subscribe)
- [State](Behavioral/State.cpp)
- [Strategy](Behavioral/Strategy.cpp) (Policy)
- [Template Method](Behavioral/TemplateMethod.cpp)
- [Visitor](Behavioral/Visitor.cpp)

## Creational

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that
deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner
suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result
in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design
patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation

- [Abstract Factory](Creational/AbstractFactory.cpp) (Kit)
- [Builder](Creational/Builder.cpp)
- [Factory Method](Creational/FactoryMethod.cpp) (Virtual Constructor)
- [Prototype](Creational/Prototype.cpp)
- [Singleton](Creational/Singleton.cpp)

## Structural

In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that
ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities

- [Adapter](Structural/Adapter.cpp) (Wrapper)
- [Bridge](Structural/Bridge.cpp) (Handle/Body)
- [Composite](Structural/Composite.cpp)
- [Decorator](Structural/Decorator.cpp) (Wrapper)
- [Facade](Structural/Facade.cpp)
- [Flyweight](Structural/Flyweight.cpp)
- [Proxy](Structural/Proxy.cpp) (Surrogate)
